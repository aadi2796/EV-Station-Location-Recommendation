# EV-Station-Location-Recommendation
In this comprehensive project, an in-depth investigation into California's charging station infrastructure was undertaken. The research encompassed meticulous data gathering and a profound analysis of various factors influencing the charging station model. Utilizing the powerful data visualization tool Tableau, a vivid and insightful representation of the charging station landscape in California was created.

To further enhance the predictive capabilities of the study, a sophisticated Python-based machine learning model was developed. This cutting-edge model was trained to forecast the optimal number of charging stations required to effectively cater to the ever-growing demand of electric vehicles (EVs) across the state. By incorporating advanced machine learning algorithms, the model has the potential to accurately anticipate the future needs of EV owners, contributing to the establishment of an efficient and sustainable charging network.

Recognizing the significance of geospatial analysis in this context, an integration of spatial data was performed to identify and propose the most suitable locations for setting up charging stations. The geospatial analysis aimed to pinpoint areas with high EV adoption rates, traffic patterns, urban development, and other relevant factors. This enabled the identification of strategic locations that would optimize the accessibility and usability of the EV charging station network, encouraging the seamless adoption of electric vehicles throughout California.

By combining in-depth research, powerful data visualization, advanced machine learning techniques, and geospatial insights, this project not only sheds light on the current state of California's charging infrastructure but also provides valuable recommendations for building a sustainable, efficient, and user-friendly EV charging network to support the ongoing EV revolution in the state.
